subtitle: Why Black Rhino?
---

Black Rhino is an open source easy-to-use-and-adapt economic/financial network multi-agent simulation (MAS) that serves two purposes:

1. Make it easier for policy makers to run ABMs,
2. Make it easier for economist to create ABMs.

In line with our first goal, Black Rhino can be used as a practical tool to simulate and analyse a model economic / banking system. This is particularly handy for central banks and policy makers, as Black Rhino fills a gap in the policy-toolbox.

Second, and perhaps more importantly, Black Rhino is a python module that can be easily adapted, changed, and modified for research purposes. It is intended to reduce the amount of work necessary to write an economic or financial MAS and hence allows researchers to focus on the economic questions instead of worrying about code design patterns and basic functionality. As such it may be particularly useful for both experienced researchers as well as graduate and PhD students.

This software is intended for educational and research purposes. Despite best efforts, we cannot fully rule out the possibility of errors and bugs. A number of tests are provided together with the software that aim to minimize this risk, but the use of Black Rhino is entirely at your own risk.
