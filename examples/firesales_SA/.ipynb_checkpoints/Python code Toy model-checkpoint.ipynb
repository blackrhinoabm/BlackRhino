    "Kindly find attached a folder containing python code for the toy model in the stock flow presentation. The coding of system wide stress simulation is part of my deliverables. In addition, I thought it may be useful for you to have an object orientated programming framework in python because it is associated with agent based modelling.  In object-oriented programming languages, data and programming methods or functions are “embedded” in objects that can manipulate their own data and interact with other programming objects.  This makes real-world entities such as households or banks easy  to be represented. For example, in this model a natural starting point is to define an object/class called “Dealer banks”. I specified information dealers would need to have and rules for how they interact with each other and their environment. Another feature of object-oriented programming that is good for ABM development is inheritance. An instantiated object, e.g. commercial bank, can ‘inherit’ some characteristics from a ‘parent class’ but still behave in different ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the obvious downside is that Python coding is definitely harder than Matlab. For example, there is no interface to click on a variable set(not that I\"m aware of anyway), you have to save the variables in a dataframe (by writing a function in the  code) and then write the  dataframe to a csv file. On the upside, it’s possible to automate the update state easily and add heterogenous behavior for same-type like institutions. Another feature is that \n",
